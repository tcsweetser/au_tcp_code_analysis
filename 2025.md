Based on the **2025 TCP Code (C628:2025)**, the implications for **Technical Support** teams are significant, moving beyond just "fixing faults" to a broader mandate of accessible, "live" human support and proactive vulnerability management.

Here is the briefing on the key operational changes required for Technical Support.

### 1. "Live" Human Support is Mandatory
**Reference:** *Clause 6.1.2 – 6.1.4*
Reliance solely on AI, chatbots, or automated ticketing systems during operating hours is no longer compliant.
*   **Real-Time Contact:** You must provide at least one **"live"** contact channel (e.g., telephone or live chat) where customers can communicate with a staff member in real-time or near real-time (Cl. 6.1.2).
*   **Escalation to Voice:** If your primary support channel is digital (e.g., chat/app), you must have a clear escalation pathway for the customer to **speak to a real person** (Cl. 6.1.4(b)). This could be a callback system or a provided phone number after triage.
*   **Exclusion:** Automated bots or AI do **not** count as a "live" channel (Note to Cl. 6.1.2).

### 2. Case Management & First Contact Resolution
**Reference:** *Clause 6.1.6 & 2.2.18*
The Code targets the "customer run-around" where consumers have to repeat their story to multiple agents.
*   **Case Management Protocol:** You must implement a case management process that accommodates different customer needs (Cl. 6.1.6).
    *   *Implication:* Ticketing systems must persist data so customers do not have to repeat details, especially for sensitive cases like Domestic and Family Violence (DFV) or ongoing technical disputes.
*   **First Contact Resolution (FCR):** The CSP must monitor FCR levels and take reasonable steps to address root causes why enquiries aren't resolved the first time (Cl. 2.2.18).
*   **Wait Times:** You must monitor average wait times and keep them "to a minimum in the circumstances" (Cl. 2.2.17).

### 3. Vulnerability Awareness & Identification
**Reference:** *Clause 3.2.1 & 2.2.4*
Technical Support agents are often the first to hear about a customer's life circumstances (e.g., "I need my internet for my dialysis machine" or "I can't pay because I lost my job").
*   **Proactive ID:** Staff must be trained and resourced to **proactively identify** consumers in vulnerable circumstances (Cl. 3.2.1(b)).
*   **Referral Pathways:** Agents must know how to refer customers to internal financial hardship teams or external support services (Cl. 3.2.1(c)).
*   **Priority Assistance:** While not new, the Code reinforces supporting consumers with identified needs (e.g., disabilities, life-threatening medical conditions).

### 4. Training & Competency
**Reference:** *Clause 2.2*
*   **Mandatory Scope:** Technical support staff are defined as "customer-facing staff" and must receive tailored training on identifying consumer needs, vulnerability, and Code awareness (Cl. 2.2.4).
*   **100% Pass Rate:** Agents cannot interact with customers until they have achieved a **100% pass rate** on their Code compliance assessment (Cl. 2.2.11).
*   **Annual Refresher:** Training must be refreshed annually (Cl. 2.2.8).

### 5. Accessibility & Communication
**Reference:** *Clause 3.1*
*   **Plain Language:** All communication, including technical troubleshooting steps, must be in **plain language** (Cl. 3.1.1). Avoid jargon where possible.
*   **Interpreter Services:** Agents must be able to communicate effectively in the CSP's primary language. Information on accessing interpreter services (TIS) and the National Relay Service (NRS) must be available (Cl. 3.1.5).
*   **Digital Accessibility:** Any new digital support content (apps, help pages, portals) must conform to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards (Cl. 3.1.8).

### 6. Record Keeping & "Customer History"
**Reference:** *Clause 6.1.7*
*   **Access to Records:** Technical support agents must have access to previous interaction records to aid in resolving enquiries (Cl. 6.1.7(a)).
*   **Customer Access:** If a customer asks for a copy of their support interactions (chat logs, notes), we must provide them (Cl. 6.1.7(b)).

### Summary of Actions for Technical Support Management:
1.  **Staffing Review:** Ensure "live" channels (Voice/Chat) are adequately staffed to meet FCR and minimum wait time obligations.
2.  **System Upgrade:** Verify CRM/Ticketing systems allow seamless transfer of customer context (notes/history) to prevent customers from having to repeat themselves.
3.  **Training Rollout:** Schedule specific training on **identifying vulnerability** in a technical support context (e.g., recognizing stress cues during outages).
4.  **Escalation Path:** Formalize and document the process for digital-first customers to request and receive a voice callback or phone number.
