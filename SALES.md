**The Headline:** The "hard sell" is out. The "suitable sell" is in. Failing to follow these steps puts your commission—and your ability to sell—at risk.

### 1. You Must Disclose Your Commission (New Scripting)
**Impact:** Immediate change to how you introduce yourself or close a deal.
*   **The Rule:** If you earn a commission, bonus, or incentive for the sale, you **must tell the customer** before the sale is finalized.
*   **What to do:** Incorporate a simple disclosure into your script (e.g., *"Just so you know, I do receive an incentive for selling this product, but my priority is ensuring it meets your needs."*).

### 2. You Must "Down-Sell" if Appropriate
**Impact:** You can no longer default to pitching the highest-tier plan.
*   **The Rule:** You are legally required to have a "needs-based discussion." If a lower-cost plan suits the customer's needs better than the premium one, you **must inform them** about that lower-cost option.
*   **What to do:** Ask about data usage and budget *first*. Do not push a $100 plan to a customer who only needs a $40 plan.

### 3. The "Needs" Check is Mandatory (Not Optional)
**Impact:** Sales conversations will take slightly longer.
*   **The Rule:** Before the sale, you must assess suitability based on **cost**, **data/speed**, and **contract length**.
*   **Mobile Specific:** You **must offer to check coverage** at the customer’s specific locations (home/work) using the coverage map. You must record that they said "yes" or "no" to this offer.

### 4. Stricter Credit Checks (The $300 Rule)
**Impact:** You will be performing external credit checks on far more customers.
*   **The Rule:** For new residential customers, if the total cost of the contract (plan + device repayment) could result in a debt of **$300 or more**, you MUST do an external credit check.
*   **Information Gathering:** You cannot just ask for ID. You must capture employment status (e.g., casual/full-time) and affordability indicators (e.g., income source).

### 5. The "Gatekeeper" on Your Commission
**Impact:** Volume isn't enough to get paid anymore.
*   **The Rule:** Your eligibility for commission is now tied to a "Responsible Selling" score. If you hit your sales targets but fail the compliance check (e.g., you skipped the coverage check or didn't provide the CIS), you may **lose your incentive** for that period.
*   **Clawbacks:** If a customer cancels later because you sold them a product they couldn't use (e.g., bad coverage) or afford (vulnerability), your commission can be clawed back.

### 6. Documents *Before* The Sale
**Impact:** Change to transaction flow.
*   **The Rule:** The Critical Information Summary (CIS) must be provided **before** the sale is closed.
*   **The Ack:** You must get the customer to acknowledge they have received/seen it.
*   **Phone Sales Exception:** If selling over the phone, they can opt-out of hearing the whole CIS, but you must send it to them within 5 days.

### 7. Training is "Pass or Pause"
**Impact:** You cannot work if you are not certified.
*   **The Rule:** You must achieve a **100% pass rate** on the TCP Code assessment.
*   **Consequence:** If you do not pass, you are legally restricted from interacting with customers until you retrain and pass.
